#Easyredmine Plugin for Franz

This repository is where the modifications of the plugin will be posted. I will try to get a pull request accepted to the main repository of plugins.

The minimum requirement to run a custom Franz integration is Franz v. 4.0.0. To get the latest version visit meetfranz.com

#Installation

To install this plugin, download the project and unzip the easyredmine folder (not the project name folder) inside the Franz Plugins folder.

To open the Franz Plugins folder on your machine:

Mac: ~Library/Application Support/Franz/Plugins/

Windows: %appdata%/Franz/Plugins

Linux: ~/.config/Franz/Plugins

Alternatively: Go to your Franz settings page, scroll down to the bottom and you will see an option to "Open the Franz plugin directory"
Copy the oratio folder into the plugins directory
Restart Franz
